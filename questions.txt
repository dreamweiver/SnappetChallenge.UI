4.What's your favourite programming language? Why?
	
	> Javascript is my favourite language, because i love the way it has been built. its dynamically typed architecture with flexible nature gives greater control over the things that are built using it.
	since JS architecture doesnt enforce lot of standards or technique on to the user, it makes it easier to develop great things with it, be it a framework or library.

	I find it very easy to code in Javascript than any other languages since it doesnt have any complex methodologies.

	Also syntactically its very easy to work with, now that  ES6 has released,the syntax is very similier to that of other Object Oriented languages like java or c#.
